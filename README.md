# Image-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning
Image distinguishment between Japanese and Chinese using Deep Learning
Objective: This project will use a deep learning algorithm to create a Chinese vs Japanese image recognition system. The system will be trained on a dataset of images of Chinese and Japanese people, and will be able to identify which nationality a given image belongs to.
